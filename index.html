    <h1> Dagadushet History</h1> <hr>
    <p>Dagadusheth Halwai was a successful sweet seller (Halwai) and a rich &#128508;	
businessman in the city of <b> Pune </b> in the late <strong>1800s.</strong> His original halwai shop still exists under the name <i> "Dagdusheth Halwai Sweets" </i> near Datta Mandir in Pune.In the late 1800s, he and his wife <em>Laxmibai</em> lost their only son in a plague epidemic. The grieving couple followed the advice of a sage to build a <u>Ganesh temple</u> in Pune in his memory.[5] Later, Dagdusheth adopted, his nephew Govindsheth (born 1865) who was 9 years old at the time of his death. Govindsheth replaced the first Ganesh idol by a new one, with the first one still being present at Akra <mark>Maruti Chowk</mark>. A generous man, he established an additional Ganesh idol in a wrestling gym called Jagoba Dada Talim. This talim was owned by Dagdusheth as he was also a former wrestling trainer. One of the chowk (square) in Pune is named Govind Halwai Chowk, after him. Along with his mother, Govindsheth handled all the programmes like Ganesh Utsav, Datta Jayanti and other festivities. The residence where they resided is now known as Laxmibai Dagdusheth Halwai Sansthan Datta Mandir Trust. Laxmi Road in Pune is named after Laxmibai Dagdusheth halwai.[citation needed] Govindsheth died in 1943. His son Dattatray Govindsheth Halwai, born in 1926, was the one who established the third Ganesh idol replacing the second.This idol, known as Navasacha Ganpati, is the one that is present today in the Dagdusheth temple. It proved to be an epoch-making event in Indian history.</p>
